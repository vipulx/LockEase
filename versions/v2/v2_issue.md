Based on your provided ESPHome configuration, here's a detailed enhancement plan for a "v2" of your LockEase project.

## Key Enhancements for v2 üîê‚ú®

The current configuration is a solid foundation, but there are several areas to improve for better security, user experience, and overall functionality. These enhancements focus on modularity, robust error handling, and adding new features.

## 1. Security & Access Control

Your current security model has some vulnerabilities. v2 should address these.

### Problem
* The **admin code** (`"2468"`) and **disarm/arm codes** (`"0152"`, `"9999"`) are **hardcoded**. This is a major security risk, as anyone with access to the YAML file can see them.
* The RFID logic only checks for two specific tags and immediately grants access. There's no way to manage multiple users or revoke access without modifying the code.
* The `admin_unlocked` state is a single boolean that expires after 60 seconds, which is a bit rigid.

### Solution
* **Move all codes to secrets:** Create a `secrets.yaml` file to store sensitive data like PINs and RFID tags. This is the **most critical** change.
    * `!secret disarm_code`
    * `!secret arm_code`
    * `!secret admin_code`
    * `!secret rfid_tag_1`
    * `!secret rfid_tag_2`
    
    This keeps your main ESPHome file clean and secure.

* **Implement a more flexible RFID management system:** Instead of hardcoding `if (x == "...")`, use a loop to check against a list of approved tags. You can store these tags in a separate file or even retrieve them from Home Assistant.
    * Create a Home Assistant `input_text` entity for each user's RFID tag, or a single entity that stores a comma-separated list of tags. The ESPHome device can then read and validate against this list.

* **Add a failed attempts counter and lockout:** After a certain number of incorrect PIN or RFID attempts (e.g., 3-5), a lockout mechanism should be triggered. This could involve:
    * Temporarily disabling the keypad for a set duration (e.g., 60 seconds).
    * Sending a notification to Home Assistant.
    * Displaying an "Access Denied - Locked Out" message on the OLED.

* **Refine the `admin_unlocked` logic:**
    * Instead of a simple boolean, create an `enum` or a set of states for the admin mode: `ADMIN_LOCKED`, `ADMIN_UNLOCKED`, `ADMIN_IN_PROGRESS`. This makes the state machine clearer.
    * Add a visual indicator on the OLED (e.g., a small "ADMIN" icon or text) when admin mode is active.

## 2. User Interface & Experience (OLED & Keypad)

The current UI is functional but lacks polish and clarity.

### Problem
* The current navigation `on_key` lambda is complex and a bit convoluted. Navigation keys are not clearly defined, and their function changes based on `admin_unlocked` state.
* The OLED display code is a long `if/else if` chain, making it hard to read and extend.
* The "Coming Soon" pages (`current_page` 3 and 4) are placeholders and don't provide value.
* The `wrap_text` function in the OLED lambda is a good idea but could be more robust.

### Solution
* **Simplify keypad logic:**
    * Separate key actions into distinct, named `script`s. For example, instead of a long `lambda`, have `on_key: A then: script.execute: prev_page` and `on_key: B then: script.execute: next_page`.
    * Create a specific `script` for the `A` then `B` admin sequence to keep the code organized.
    * Clearly define the purpose of the `C` and `D` keys, as their current function is redundant with `A` and `B`. Consider re-purposing them for other functions like "Back" or "Enter/Execute."

* **Improve the OLED display handler:**
    * Replace the long `if/else if` chain with a `switch` statement based on `id(current_page)`. This is more readable and efficient.
    * Implement dedicated functions for each page's display logic. For example, `display_home_page(it)` and `display_info_page(it)`. This makes the code modular and easier to debug.
    * Add a dedicated page for user-friendly configuration of Wi-Fi or PINs.

* **Add haptic or auditory feedback:** Integrate a small buzzer or a vibration motor. A `beep` on keypress or a different sound for "Access Granted" vs. "Access Denied" would significantly improve the user experience.

* **Optimize the display `lambda`:**
    * Use a separate `script` to handle display updates. Call `component.update` only when necessary (e.g., after a key press, state change) to reduce processor load.

## 3. Functionality & Extensibility

The current project is a simple prototype. v2 should be a more complete, feature-rich device.

### Problem
* The **`lock_relay`** is just a simple `switch`. There's no built-in logic for a timed unlock. A user might enter the PIN, and the door unlocks, but it remains unlocked unless they manually lock it.

### Solution
* **Add a timed lock function:**
    * When the correct PIN or RFID is used, turn the `lock_relay` on for a set duration (e.g., 5 seconds) using `delay` and then turn it off automatically.
    * This is a crucial security feature. The user should not have to remember to re-lock the door.

* **Enhance Admin Menu:**
    * Currently, the Admin Menu is just a placeholder. Implement the functions listed:
        * **Reset Config:** A `script` that uses `esphome.reboot` and perhaps clears some internal variables.
        * **Toggle Display:** A `switch` or `binary_sensor` that controls the `display_on` global variable.
        * **Change PINs:** Add a function to change the `disarm_code`, `arm_code`, and `admin_code` directly from the keypad and save them to a `text_sensor` or Home Assistant. This is more user-friendly than requiring a re-flash.

* **Add a dedicated Home Assistant switch to lock/unlock:** Create a `switch` or `button` in ESPHome that, when triggered from Home Assistant, can perform a full lock/unlock cycle, including the timed release of the relay.

* **Refactor `globals`:** The current globals are a good start, but consider organizing them into logical groups or using `id:`'s that are more descriptive. For instance, `current_page` is good, but `pin_entry_state` might be better than `entering_pin_page`.

## 4. Code Quality & Best Practices

The existing code can be made more robust and easier to maintain.

### Problem
* The lambda functions are long and contain multiple logical blocks.
* There's no clear separation of concerns. The keypad `on_key` lambda handles navigation, PIN entry, and admin sequence detection all in one place.
* The font definitions are redundant. You have `font1`, `font2`, `font3` and also `fontSmall`, `fontmMedium`, `fontLarge`, which is confusing.

### Solution
* **Break down `lambda`s into `script`s:** As mentioned, use `script`s to encapsulate actions. For example, instead of a long `on_result` lambda for the `pincode_reader`, have it call a script like `check_pin_and_actuate_lock`.
* **Clean up `globals` and `fonts`:**
    * Consolidate font definitions and give them meaningful names (e.g., `font_small`, `font_medium`, `font_large`).
    * Organize `globals` into categories with comments for clarity.
* **Add comments:** Use comments to explain the purpose of complex logic blocks, especially in `lambda` functions.
* **Implement a "state machine" approach:** Use a global variable like `system_state` (e.g., `HOME`, `ENTERING_PIN`, `ADMIN_MENU`, `RFID_SCANNING`) to control the behavior of the device. This makes the `on_key` and `display` logic much simpler, as they only need to check the current state to know what to do.
