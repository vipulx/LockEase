### Feature Improvements for LockEase v2.0 

Here are the key features and enhancements implemented in the V2.0 ESPHome configuration, focusing on security, user experience, and functionality.

***

### 1. Enhanced Security and Access Control üîí

* **Secrets Management**: All sensitive information, including Wi-Fi credentials, API keys, and access codes (`disarm_code`, `arm_code`, `admin_code`, and RFID tags), has been moved to a separate `secrets.yaml` file. This prevents hardcoding of credentials directly in the main configuration file, making the project more secure and easier to share without compromising sensitive data.
* **Failed Attempts Lockout**: A new security mechanism tracks failed PIN and RFID attempts using the `failed_attempts` global variable. After three incorrect attempts, the system enters a 60-second lockout period, preventing brute-force attacks. During this time, all keypad and RFID input is ignored.
* **Timed Lock Activation**: The `lock_relay` now activates for a set duration (5 seconds) upon successful disarming with a PIN or RFID tag. This ensures the lock automatically re-engages, preventing it from being left in an unlocked state accidentally.

### 2. Improved User Experience and UI üé®

* **Clearer PIN Entry and Admin Modes**: The `entering_pin_page` and `admin_entry_mode` globals now provide distinct visual feedback on the OLED screen. The display clearly shows "Enter PIN" or "Admin Access," informing the user of the current state.
* **Modular Display Logic**: The long `if/else if` chain for the OLED display has been replaced with a `switch` statement based on the `current_page` variable. This makes the code cleaner, more readable, and easier to expand with new pages in the future.
* **Admin Menu Functionality**: The "Admin Menu" page (`current_page` 5), which was a placeholder in V1.0, is now functional. It provides options for a user with admin access to execute specific scripts directly from the keypad, such as disarming the alarm, toggling the display on/off, and manually toggling the lock.

### 3. Code Refinement and Robustness üõ†Ô∏è

* **Refactored `on_key` Logic**: The complex `on_key` lambda for the keypad has been broken down into a more logical sequence. It now prioritizes lockout checks, followed by admin entry, PIN entry, and finally, navigation. This structured approach prevents conflicts and makes the keypad's behavior more predictable.
* **Consolidated Globals and Fonts**: The global variables have been reorganized with comments for clarity. Redundant font definitions have been removed, standardizing the fonts to prevent confusion and streamline the display code.
* **Simplified RFID Logic**: Instead of using a hardcoded `if` statement for each RFID tag, the code now uses a `std::vector` to hold a list of allowed tags from the `secrets.yaml` file. This makes it easier to add or remove tags without changing the core logic.
